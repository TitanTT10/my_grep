# my grep
This is a simple grep clone I copied from a YouTube tutorial.

You run it by typing `cargo run -- 'pattern' 'file'`. <br>
When you want to search multiple files at the same time, just add them separated by a space. <br>
Use the `-i` flag to turn on case insensitivity. <br>
(It only works when you are in the "my_grep/" directory!)
